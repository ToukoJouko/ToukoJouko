## Hello!

My name is Touko Pakarinen. I am a 2nd year CS student in the University of Eastern Finland.
Currently my main focus is in learning fullstack-web development, and improving my skills in the languages/technologies i have listed in the _skills_ section.

Here in my github you can find projects i have created as a part of my studies or in my freetime.
